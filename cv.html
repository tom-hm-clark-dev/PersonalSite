    <h2>
      Education
    </h2>

    <p>
      At Aberystwyth University I studied web development, where I learned key practical skills 
      such as web programming using HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript, software engineering with the 
      languages C, Java and Kotlin, testing and debugging code using JQuery, creating and 
      managing relational databases by way of MySQL, and network administration and security 
      using Linux. In the theory modules I studied the business applications of these technologies 
      as well as examined e-commerce strategies.
      <br>
      <br>
      Some key projects I have completed as part of my university course include:
    </p>
      <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li class="cvlist">
          A Wordpress based site for 
          Stitch Up Music Group, a Mid Wales based live music promotion company.
        </li> 

        <li class="cvlist">
          A JavaScript game loosely inspired Space Invaders.
        </li>

        <li class="cvlist">
          An educational quiz system as a member of a group project.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
      At university I was also a founding member of a new society, BandSoc, a society dedicated to 
      bringing like-minded musicians together with the goal of getting more local bands together 
      in the Aberystwyth area.
      </p>
    
      <h2>
        Activities
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>I play drums in two bands, for which I design posters and merch, producing 
          designs that all members are satisfied with the outcome but also ensuring they are 
          in line with the criteria or guidelines set by the hosting venue. 
        </li>
        <li>
          I have a keen interest in building and upgrading PC hardware, including 
          the PC that I use on a daily basis and machines for friends. 
        </li>
